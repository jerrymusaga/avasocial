An NFT marketplace on Avalanche powered by SpruceID and ENS (Ethereum Name Service) bringing together the best of both worlds: a high-performance blockchain, robust identity management, and decentralized domain naming.

## Overview
Avasocial is a cutting-edge NFT marketplace built on the Avalanche blockchain that leverages the secure identity management of SpruceID and the user-friendly domain naming system of ENS. This marketplace aims to provide artists with a seamless and secure platform to mint, buy, react, and showcase NFTs.

## Features
- SpruceID Integration: Users on Avasocial would have the option to integrate their SpruceID identity through Sign-In with Ethereum, enhancing session authentication within the platform. A user connects wallet with metamask first and then logs in through Sign-In With Ethereum(SIWE)
